**We briefly discussed EMFs on our call, so I wanted to send you one quick tip to reduce your exposure.** 

- I’d suggest turning your WiFi router off at night, which will meaningfully reduce your RF exposure. For convenience, you can use remotes like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Syantek-Wireless-Household-Appliances-Certified/dp/B08MFBDGGF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2OASHJ07Z6ZCP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UlTcb7APLZIpqx9Z7fk4TLiU4wHRxWleiBbTEj_xxQNOXA0dWPF2LCOG8rmzCU4XwcCgTbAAuSnGx9jld8oqiG2z0MJKhrjIFc5UIsjWx4l0FSHuJJ9NfevZjj5zzCUDmXZoxIOQe4XDivkSr-k5v80ZBcFLGPQTl99UrTWIWVcqqgEvgJ8Kgyf-D9kL4EDr4Cz7MIYx9azSsQnk8Tt9BRBKifAHVo1WhIETJEQPjfo.c3oh_4Yw5DPx6LdmPN0FHFePAAwhvsZGAw12_cVVigQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=remote+kill+switch+outlet&qid=1759096120&sprefix=remote+kill+switch+outle%2Caps%2C279&sr=8-4) or a [physical timer](https://www.amazon.com/Century-Indoor-24-Hour-Mechanical-Outlet/dp/B01LPSGBZS/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1UA2QDWNHITA7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ADoKC6t0Q5jr7l0tXd8Updt256qGdTiJ3cK9sKERnOhh96AZVVquKqBAB61LhaScfRWnEy1M25VHay0fobHLyHrz3w5CvorykRck1Ofp8k-JfxR-_7Fu9bCn9i423lfZatyB-sFsXfLTW-68hezfMvz63rSnkttM7mghfruAu2YENPBi78z_NFn1r3yvMI52HyZ-Zo1MzsI_xwT-HIMfKSxn-SEw6ailaULS1MkTpotOfI_7C-ZVh3cRGez_8hwSfo9Hs3suomG1C2lxLYzBmlni9t9WG_rk-6Zrw1jFhKE.zpFEmDsXVptsnbIHSF5BRH6ekzj3kPuVDiQ0Kt6jwe0&dib_tag=se&keywords=killswitch%2Btimer&qid=1759427022&sprefix=killswitch%2Btim%2Caps%2C260&sr=8-11&th=1), which will cut power to the router automatically. However, if certain systems require WiFi overnight (e.g. security systems), some adjustments may be needed, such as hardwiring specific areas of the home or switching those systems to wired connections.

**You mentioned using air purifiers, which is great.** 

- One thing to keep in mind is to run them continuously at the highest fan-speed setting that’s still comfortable in terms of noise. Air purifiers set to “Auto” mode only run when particulate matter reaches certain concentrations and particle sizes, which means smaller particles can accumulate in the meantime.

**You mentioned you're pregnant, so I wanted to share a quick suggestion.**

- I’d recommend getting air purifiers (ideally covering the whole home, but prioritising the bedroom). Here's a link to our [guide](https://lightwork-home-health.kit.com/posts/the-most-reliable-way-to-improve-your-home-s-air-quality-air-filtration-demystified?_gl=1*36bh0v*_gcl_au*MTU4NTUzNzE2Mi4xNzU2ODM3NTkwLjExNDc2NTMwMDcuMTc2MzMxMDMxNC4xNzYzMzEwMzEz) on how to choose the right air filter. Studies have linked elevated particulate matter during pregnancy to changes in blood markers and metabolism, so addressing this is important. Also, when you get the air purifier, make sure it’s running continuously at the highest fan-speed setting that’s still comfortable in terms of noise. Air purifiers set to “Auto” mode react only when particulate matter reaches certain concentrations and particle sizes, which means smaller particles can accumulate in the meantime.

**You mentioned sleep was a concern**,

- So I wanted to recommend reducing your AC electrical field exposure in the bedroom. A simple way to do this is to move your bed 6–12 inches away from the wall and unplug nearby electronics like chargers and lamps. More involved remediation may be needed depending on the field strength, but this is a great initial step.  For convenience, you can use remotes like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Syantek-Wireless-Household-Appliances-Certified/dp/B08MFBDGGF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2OASHJ07Z6ZCP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UlTcb7APLZIpqx9Z7fk4TLiU4wHRxWleiBbTEj_xxQNOXA0dWPF2LCOG8rmzCU4XwcCgTbAAuSnGx9jld8oqiG2z0MJKhrjIFc5UIsjWx4l0FSHuJJ9NfevZjj5zzCUDmXZoxIOQe4XDivkSr-k5v80ZBcFLGPQTl99UrTWIWVcqqgEvgJ8Kgyf-D9kL4EDr4Cz7MIYx9azSsQnk8Tt9BRBKifAHVo1WhIETJEQPjfo.c3oh_4Yw5DPx6LdmPN0FHFePAAwhvsZGAw12_cVVigQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=remote+kill+switch+outlet&qid=1759096120&sprefix=remote+kill+switch+outle%2Caps%2C279&sr=8-4) to easily cut power to the devices.

**You mentioned you're using a wireless baby monitor.**

- Ideally, we’d go wired, but if that’s not practical, I’d recommend using a [baby monitor shield](https://lessemf.com/product/baby-monitor-shield/) (I’m happy to order one for you if you send me your address). The \[Nanit\] is a significant source of RF EMF — increasing distance will also help, but the shield reduces exposure by an additional \~70%.  
- As a precautionary step, I’d also move the crib 6–12 inches away from the wall. We frequently find elevated electrical fields behind bedroom walls from wiring, and increasing distance can significantly reduce exposure.

**You mentioned having mold test results, feel free to send them over and I’ll review them.**

**\[introduce them to relevant mold experts\]** 

**You mentioned spending a lot of time at your desk, so I’d treat that as a priority exposure area.** 

- A few quick recommendations to meaningfully reduce EMF exposure:  
  - Replace ungrounded power strips with grounded versions (like [this one](https://safelivingtechnologies.com/products/emf-shielded-grounded-power-strip.html) or [this one with USB/USB-C ports](https://techwellness.com/collections/best-emf-protection/products/no-emf-usb-charger-and-power-strip-safer-usb-c-charging-too)).  
  - Swap unshielded extension cords for [shielded ones](https://lessemf.com/product/shielded-power-cord/).  
- I’d also start measuring CO₂ as a proxy for ventilation (with a device like [this one](https://aranet.com/en/home/products/aranet4-home?srsltid=AfmBOorJFFiW60KlKV5Aiuue4dBHpYLxGBWIzWvdDfl6pJzjHs64L7_W)). When CO₂ levels exceed \~800–1000 ppm, this has been linked to reduced cognitive performance, so opening windows or increasing ventilation helps. I’d also recommend keeping the monitor in your bedroom overnight to see if ventilation is a concern there and whether additional interventions are needed. Here’s a link to the [guide](https://ckarchive.com/b/92uzhnh6z26pns3roomrdfzpxl933iwhzmo2r) we wrote.

**You mentioned asthma or respiratory concerns, so particulate matter is a key focus.** 

- I’d recommend getting multiple HEPA filters to cover the home, prioritising the bedrooms. Here's a link to our [guide](https://lightwork-home-health.kit.com/posts/the-most-reliable-way-to-improve-your-home-s-air-quality-air-filtration-demystified?_gl=1*36bh0v*_gcl_au*MTU4NTUzNzE2Mi4xNzU2ODM3NTkwLjExNDc2NTMwMDcuMTc2MzMxMDMxNC4xNzYzMzEwMzEz) on how to choose the right air filter. When you get the air purifier, make sure it’s running continuously at the highest fan-speed setting that’s still comfortable in terms of noise. Air purifiers set to “Auto” mode react only when particulate matter reaches certain concentrations and particle sizes, which means smaller particles can accumulate in the meantime.  
- I’d also recommend deep cleaning / regularly HEPA-vacuuming areas where particulate matter builds up — rugs, bedding, carpets, etc. Just make sure the vacuum has a HEPA filter so particles aren’t released back into the air.

**On the call, you mentioned using grounding products**. 

- These can be great, but there could be a couple of potential concerns depending on how they’re used. For example, if your home has electronic interference on the wiring and you plug your grounding product into that system, you could end up being exposed to it. Similarly, if there are wiring errors or you’re using the product in a room with elevated electrical fields, it can create issues. We typically recommend using an outdoor ground instead, where the product connects to a grounding rod installed directly in the soil outside.
