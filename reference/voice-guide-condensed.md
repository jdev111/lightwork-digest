## Template C: Key Findings (FU3) — FIXED TEMPLATE

Hey {first_name},

I wanted to share a few examples of problems we've found in recent home assessments.

We identified several critical issues that many homeowners aren't aware of:

- Hidden mold contamination despite multiple previous professional tests which gave the "all clear." We advised on a specialist manual inspection and coordinated next steps with our recommended inspector for the area.
- Elevated trihalomethanes in shower water (which we continue to see in many homes we test). These can be vaporized in hot shower water and have carcinogenic risks from inhalation and dermal absorption. We recommended filtration designed to address these specific contaminants.
- Significant indoor particulate matter, especially at the ultrafine size, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. We advised on an optimal filtration strategy as well as a VOC removal strategy to address exposure from recent furnishings.
- Significant AC electrical fields impacting all bedrooms, including children's rooms. We advised on the tradeoffs between kill switches, shielding paint, and other solutions.

This is why our clients trust us. Our assessments uncover hidden risks and provide clear, actionable solutions tailored to each home. Shall we schedule a follow-up to go over any questions?
