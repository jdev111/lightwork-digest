TOPIC: EMFs / WiFi
TRIGGER: mentioned EMFs, WiFi, router, RF exposure
TIP: Turn WiFi router off at night to reduce RF exposure. Use a remote switch or physical timer to cut power automatically. If security systems need WiFi overnight, consider hardwiring those devices.

TOPIC: Air purifiers / Air quality
TRIGGER: mentioned air purifiers, air quality, particulate matter, asthma, respiratory
TIP: Run air purifiers continuously at the highest comfortable fan speed. "Auto" mode only reacts at certain concentrations and particle sizes, so smaller particles accumulate in the meantime.

TOPIC: Pregnancy / Baby
TRIGGER: mentioned pregnant, baby, expecting, nursery
TIP: Prioritize air purifiers (especially bedroom). Studies link elevated particulate matter during pregnancy to changes in blood markers and metabolism. Run purifiers continuously, not on Auto mode.

TOPIC: Sleep
TRIGGER: mentioned sleep, insomnia, bedroom, rest
TIP: Reduce AC electrical field exposure in the bedroom. Move bed 6-12 inches from the wall and unplug nearby electronics (chargers, lamps). Use a remote switch for convenience.

TOPIC: Baby monitor
TRIGGER: mentioned baby monitor, Nanit, wireless monitor
TIP: Use a baby monitor shield to reduce RF exposure by ~70%. Also move crib 6-12 inches from the wall, as wiring behind walls often creates elevated electrical fields.

TOPIC: Mold
TRIGGER: mentioned mold, mold test, musty smell, moisture
TIP: Offer to review any existing mold test results. Connect with relevant mold experts if needed.

TOPIC: Desk / Home office
TRIGGER: mentioned desk, home office, working from home, office setup
TIP: Replace ungrounded power strips with grounded versions. Swap unshielded extension cords for shielded ones. Measure CO2 as a ventilation proxy; levels above 800-1000 ppm reduce cognitive performance.

TOPIC: Asthma / Respiratory
TRIGGER: mentioned asthma, respiratory concerns, breathing issues, allergies
TIP: Get multiple HEPA filters to cover the home, prioritizing bedrooms. Run continuously at highest comfortable fan speed (not Auto mode). Also deep clean and regularly HEPA-vacuum rugs, bedding, carpets where particulate matter builds up. Make sure the vacuum has a HEPA filter so particles aren't released back into the air.

TOPIC: Grounding products
TRIGGER: mentioned grounding, earthing, grounding mat, grounding sheet
TIP: Grounding products can be beneficial, but if the home has electronic interference on wiring or wiring errors, plugging into that system can increase exposure. Recommend using an outdoor ground (grounding rod in soil) instead.
