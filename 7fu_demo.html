Hey Nicolas,

Pleasure speaking with you this week. Thanks for reaching out.

A couple followup items: here&#x27;s an <a href="https://www.lightworkhome.com/examplereport">example report</a> (password: homehealth), and attached is the deck I presented with additional information.

Also, since you mentioned redoing the bedroom wiring for your dad, one thing worth noting: moving the bed 6-12 inches from the wall and unplugging nearby electronics at night helps cut down AC electrical fields while he sleeps, and you can use a remote switch like this to keep it convenient: https://www.amazon.com/Syantek-Wireless-Household-Appliances-Certified/dp/B08MFBDGGF.

Let me know if you&#x27;d like to move forward. And feel free to reach out if you have any questions, on what I&#x27;ve sent or more generally on home health.

Best,
Jay

Hey Nicolas,

Hope you&#x27;re doing well! Just wanted to check if you&#x27;d like to move forward.

Also wanted to share this recent write-up that <a href="https://x.com/awilkinson">Andrew Wilkinson</a> (co-founder of Tiny) did on our service. I thought you might find it interesting. Here&#x27;s <a href="https://www.lightworkhome.com/blog-posts/wilkinson">the link.</a>

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Nicolas,

Hope things are going well. One thing worth mentioning: we find issues in every home we test, regardless of how new or well-maintained it is. Here are a few recent examples:

- Hidden mold contamination despite multiple previous professional tests which gave the &#x27;all clear.&#x27; We advised on a specialist manual inspection and coordinated next steps with our recommended inspector for the area.
- Elevated trihalomethanes in shower water (which we continue to see in many homes we test). These can be vaporized in hot shower water and have carcinogenic risks from inhalation and dermal absorption. We recommended filtration designed to address these specific contaminants.
- Significant indoor particulate matter, especially at the ultrafine size, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. We advised on an optimal filtration strategy as well as a VOC removal strategy to address exposure from recent furnishings.
- Significant AC electrical fields impacting all bedrooms, including children&#x27;s rooms. We advised on the tradeoffs between kill switches, shielding paint, and other solutions.

This is why our clients trust us. Our work uncovers hidden risks and provides clear, actionable solutions tailored to each home. Shall we schedule a follow-up to go over any questions?

Hey Nicolas,

Just wanted to flag that we have some availability in Bogotá on April 15-18, in case that works for you. As a reminder, the total quote was for $4,000 (including the newsletter community&#x27;s 10% discount).

Below are some of our reviews which gives a nice insight into the value our clients get from the service.

&quot;Incredible service. After living in a house that nearly killed me, these guys were literally lifesavers.&quot; - Chris Williamson, Host of Modern Wisdom podcast

&quot;Lightwork&#x27;s home health audit was next level. They went deep into our lighting, air, water, EMFs, and more. We sleep easier knowing our home&#x27;s health and having fixed the key issues.&quot; - Daymond John, Shark Tank Investor

&quot;My experience with Lightwork was exceptional. Their team is incredibly knowledgeable and responsive. What stood out most was their actionable guidance. The results were immediate: I breathe easier, sleep better, and enjoy greater confidence in my home&#x27;s health.&quot; - Matthew Wadiak, Founder of Blue Apron

&quot;I genuinely thought I was doing everything right. But Lightwork found serious issues I never would have discovered on my own. They were incredibly thorough, tested every aspect of my home that could be impacting my family&#x27;s health, and then helped us get everything resolved. We made the changes right away. Highly recommend.&quot; - Andrew Wilkinson, Co-founder of Tiny

Hey Nicolas,

Wanted to share what a couple of our clinical partners have said about working with us:

&quot;We regularly refer our patients to Lightwork Home Health because holistic care requires addressing the home environment. The science is clear: environmental factors have a major impact on health.&quot; - Dr. Robert Kachko, Director of Integrative Health, Atria Institute

&quot;Lightwork&#x27;s home health assessment was incredibly detailed and insightful. I actively recommend their service to all my patients who want a healthier home and lower environmental toxin exposure.&quot; - Dr. David Boyd MD, Concierge Medicine Physician &amp; Founder, Blindspot Medical

We work closely with physicians and functional medicine practitioners who see environmental factors as a key piece of their patients&#x27; health. Happy to answer any questions.
