<h1>Post-Call Follow-Up Digest: Build Plan</h1>
<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>A Python script runs every morning at 8am. It sends you one email with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every sales call from yesterday</li>
<li>Lead context from Close.com (name, budget, health spend, home size, how they heard, why reaching out)</li>
<li>Call summary from Granola transcript (what was discussed, concerns raised, objections)</li>
<li>A personalized follow-up email draft for each call</li>
<li>Suggested follow-up timing</li>
</ul>
<p>You read it, tweak if needed, copy/paste/send.</p>

<h2>Script Flow</h2>
<pre><code>8:00 AM daily (launchd)
       |
       v
1. Pull yesterday's meetings from Close.com
   - GET /activity/meeting/?date_created__gt={yesterday}
   - Filter: title contains &quot;test call&quot;, &quot;intro call&quot;, or &quot;partner call&quot;
   - Include ALL team members (Jay, Johnny, Dom)
       |
       v
2. For each meeting, get lead details from Close.com
   - GET /lead/{lead_id}/
   - Extract: name, email, city, budget, health spend,
     sq footage, referral, why reaching out, heat level
       |
       v
3. Match meeting to Granola transcript
   - Read from Google Sheet (populated by Zapier when meetings end)
   - Match by: attendee email OR meeting title
   - Extract: full transcript text + Granola AI summary
       |
       v
4. For each call, send to Claude API:
   - Lead context (from Close)
   - Call transcript (from Granola)
   - Prompt: &quot;Summarize this call and draft a follow-up email&quot;
   - Returns: call summary + follow-up draft + suggested timing
       |
       v
5. Build HTML email grouped by team member:
   - JAY'S CALLS (Jay's section)
   - JOHNNY'S CALLS (Johnny's section)
   - DOM'S CALLS (Dom's section)
       |
       v
6. Send to jay@lightworkhome.com via Gmail SMTP
   Jay forwards relevant sections to Johnny/Dom

<h2>What Claude Generates Per Call</h2>
<p>For each call, Claude gets this context and produces:</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong>
- Lead name, city, home size, budget, health spend
- How they heard about Lightwork
- Why they're reaching out (from form)
- Full Granola transcript of the call</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Call Summary</strong> (3-4 bullet points): What was discussed, their main concerns, objections/hesitations, outcome</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Up Email Draft</strong>: Personalized based on what was discussed. References specific things from the call. Written in Lightwork's voice (practical, grounded, not salesy).</li>
<li><strong>Suggested Timing</strong>: When to send (today, 2 days, 1 week) based on how the call went</li>
<li><strong>Priority</strong>: High/Medium/Low based on budget, urgency, engagement level</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Files to Create</h2>
<pre><code>lightwork-digest/
  .env                          # API keys (already created)
  post_call_digest.py           # Main script (~200 lines)
  com.lightwork.digest.plist    # macOS launchd for daily 8am run
  README.md                     # Setup instructions
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3 (already installed)</li>
<li>No external packages needed: uses <code>urllib</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>smtplib</code>, <code>email</code> (all stdlib)</li>
<li>Anthropic API called via raw HTTP (no pip install needed)</li>
<li>Runs as macOS LaunchAgent (survives restarts, runs even if you're not logged in to terminal)</li>
</ul>

FOLLOW-UP DRAFT:
Hi Kyle, great speaking with you yesterday. To answer your question
about timeline, we can typically schedule SF assessments within

<h2>Safety: This Will NEVER Email Leads</h2>
<p>Four layers of protection:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hardcoded recipient</strong>: The ONLY recipient is <code>jay@lightworkhome.com</code>. No variable, no config, no parameter accepts other emails.</li>
<li><strong>Send guard</strong>: The send function checks the <code>to</code> address before sending. If it's not <code>jay@lightworkhome.com</code>, it throws an error and exits immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Read-only on Close.com</strong>: The script only GETs data from Close. It never POSTs, PUTs, or sends through Close.</li>
<li><strong>No lead email addresses in the <code>to</code> field</strong>: Lead emails only appear inside the digest body as text, never as recipients.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations / Things to Note</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Granola transcripts</strong>: Delivered via Zapier to Google Sheets. If Zapier hasn't synced a meeting yet, the digest will note "No transcript available" and generate the follow-up based on Close.com data only (still useful, just less personalized).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meeting filtering</strong>: The script filters for "test call", "intro call", and "partner call" in the meeting title. Internal meetings, hiring calls, etc. are excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Runs on your Mac</strong>: Requires your Mac to be on at 8am. If it's asleep, launchd will run it when it wakes up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>One-Time Setup Required</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Zapier</strong>: Create the Granola &gt; Google Sheets zap (5 min)</li>
<li>Trigger: Granola "Meeting note sent to Zapier"</li>
<li>Action: Google Sheets "Create Spreadsheet Row"</li>
<li>Map fields: title, date, attendees, transcript, summary</li>
<li><strong>Google Sheets API</strong>: Create a service account key for read access (5 min)</li>
<li><strong>Install launchd plist</strong>: One command to enable daily 8am runs</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Lead Tracking Dashboard (Google Sheet)</h2>
<p>A shared Google Sheet that auto-updates daily. The team opens it, sees who needs follow-up, and checks them off.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Hit 7 follow-ups per lead.</strong> Once all 7 are checked, the lead moves to a "Completed" tab.</p>
<h3>7-Touch Value-Driven Follow-Up Cadence</h3>
<p>Based on Jeremy Haynes' methodology: 80% pure value, 20% ask. Every email teaches something useful for their home. The value IS the follow-up. Every-other-day cadence in the early touches (converts 23% better than daily). Prospects who consume 5+ pieces of content convert at 3.4x the rate.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Touch</th>
<th>Timing</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>What</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FU 1</td>
<td>Day 1</td>
<td>Post-call value</td>
<td>Personalized tip based on what they discussed on the call. Use the sales scripts: if they mentioned sleep, send the AC electrical field tip. If they mentioned a baby, send the baby monitor shield tip. Written INTO the email, not just a link.</td>
<td>"You mentioned sleep was a concern, so here's one quick thing you can do tonight..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 2</td>
<td>Day 3</td>
<td>Second value drop</td>
<td>Different topic-specific tip from the call, OR the example report with context on why it's relevant to their situation. Still 100% value, zero ask.</td>
<td>"Also wanted to share our example report so you can see the kind of detail we go into. Given your interest in water quality, check out pages 30-35."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 3</td>
<td>Day 6</td>
<td>Social proof + value</td>
<td>Share a relevant testimonial or the Wilkinson case study, framed around their specific concern. Include one more actionable tip.</td>
<td>"Andrew Wilkinson had similar concerns about his home. Here's what we found and what he did about it. Also, one more quick tip on air filtration..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 4</td>
<td>Day 10</td>
<td>Educational content</td>
<td>Share the most relevant Lightwork newsletter article for their situation (EMF guide, mold testing guide, air quality guide). Write the key takeaway into the email body.</td>
<td>"Thought you might find this interesting, we wrote a guide on how to test for mold the right way. The key insight is..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 5</td>
<td>Day 16</td>
<td>New angle + soft ask</td>
<td>Share the science video or a different piece of content they haven't seen. First mention of "happy to continue the conversation whenever timing works."</td>
<td>"In case helpful, this video explains the science behind what we do. If you'd like to pick up where we left off, I'm here."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 6</td>
<td>Day 25</td>
<td>Availability + value</td>
<td>Share one final relevant resource. Mention specific upcoming availability in their city. Light ask.</td>
<td>"We have some availability in SF in early March. Also, thought you'd find this guide on air filtration useful for your apartment."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FU 7</td>
<td>Day 35</td>
<td>Graceful close</td>
<td>No pressure. "Totally understand if the timing isn't right. We're here whenever you're ready. In the meantime, here's one last resource." Keeps the door open.</td>
<td>"No worries at all if now isn't the right time. We're here whenever makes sense. In the meantime, thought this guide might be useful."</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Key rules (from Haynes):</strong>
- Write the value INTO the email. Don't just drop a link and say "check this out."
- Each email should be useful even if they never buy. That's what builds trust.
- Personalize based on the call transcript: reference their specific concerns, home type, city, health goals
- Never say "just checking in" or "just following up" without attaching value
- The sales scripts (EMF tips, air purifier recs, grounding product warnings) are your value ammunition</p>
<p>The daily digest email will tell you which leads are due for their next touch and draft the value-driven email for you, pulling from the transcript + sales scripts + relevant Lightwork content.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Auto-updates daily at 8am</strong> (same script that sends the digest email)</li>
<li>Pulls all active leads from Close.com (not yet converted)</li>
<li><strong>Preserves all checkboxes</strong> when updating. Script only updates data columns (last activity, days since), never overwrites the FU checkboxes.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-detects follow-ups</strong>: If Close.com shows a new outgoing email to that lead since last update, it auto-checks the next unchecked FU box</li>
<li><strong>Progress column</strong> auto-calculates (e.g., "3/7")</li>
<li>Sorted by: fewest follow-ups first, then longest days since last activity</li>
<li><strong>Conditional formatting</strong>:</li>
<li>Row RED: 0/7 follow-ups and 3+ days since call</li>
<li>Row YELLOW: Behind on cadence (next FU overdue)</li>
<li>Row GREEN: On track or completed</li>
<li>Progress bar in the Progress column</li>
</ol>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: Jay, Johnny, or Dom (from Close.com)</li>
<li><strong>Lead Name</strong>: Full name, linked to Close.com lead page</li>
<li><strong>City</strong>: Where they're based</li>
<li><strong>Budget</strong>: From form ($2-5k, $5-10k, $10k+)</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: How they heard about Lightwork</li>
<li><strong>FU 1 through FU 7</strong>: Checkboxes for each follow-up touch (manual or auto-detected)</li>
<li><strong>Progress</strong>: Auto-calculated count (e.g., "3/7")</li>
<li><strong>Last Activity</strong>: Most recent email, call, or note in Close.com</li>
<li><strong>Days Since</strong>: Days since last activity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tabs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Leads with &lt; 7 follow-ups (main working view)</li>
<li><strong>Completed</strong>: Leads with 7/7 follow-ups (archive)</li>
<li><strong>Converted</strong>: Leads who booked an assessment (win!)</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong>: Leads who explicitly said no</li>
</ul>
<h3>Access</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jay, Johnny, and Dom all have edit access</li>
<li>Anyone can check the "Followed Up" box</li>
<li>Link pinned in Slack/bookmarked in browser</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Next Steps After This</h2>
<p>Once this is working, we can add:
- Lead magnet downloaders who didn't book (from ConvertKit)
- "Going cold" alerts for leads with no activity in X days
- Automatic task creation in Close.com for each follow-up
- Weekly summary of pipeline health</p>
