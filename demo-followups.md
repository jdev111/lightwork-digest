### FU 1 (Day 1) - Post-Call Value

Hey Pete,

Great speaking with you today. Given what you mentioned about your daughter's allergies, I wanted to share a couple of things that might help right away.

First, on the air purifiers you already have: make sure they're running continuously at the highest fan-speed setting that's still comfortable noise-wise. Purifiers set to "Auto" mode only kick in when particulate matter reaches certain concentrations and particle sizes, which means smaller particles can accumulate in the meantime. Switching to continuous mode is one of the simplest upgrades you can make.

Second, it's worth deep cleaning and regularly HEPA-vacuuming areas where particulate matter builds up: rugs, bedding, carpets. Just make sure the vacuum itself has a HEPA filter so particles aren't released back into the air.

On the mold side, you mentioned you had a mold inspection already. If it was an air sample test, it's worth knowing that air sampling is notorious for false negatives if not done in an unusually rigorous way. If the results came back negative, that doesn't necessarily mean the house is clean. Happy to take a look at the results if you want to send them over.

Best,
Jay

### FU 2 (Day 3) - Second Value Drop

Hey Pete,

One more thing I wanted to share that's relevant to your daughter's situation.

I'd recommend getting a CO2 monitor (something like the Aranet4) and keeping it in her bedroom overnight. When CO2 levels exceed around 800-1000 ppm, it's been linked to reduced cognitive performance and poor sleep quality. In tightly sealed homes with limited ventilation, we regularly see levels well above this, especially in bedrooms with the door closed.

It's a quick way to see if ventilation is part of the picture. If levels are high, simply cracking a window or running a fan can make a meaningful difference. Here's a guide we wrote on the topic: [link to CO2/ventilation guide]

Also, here's our example report so you can see the level of detail we go into. Given your interest in mold and air quality, pages 12-18 (air quality section) and pages 38-42 (mold likelihood) would be the most relevant for your situation.

### FU 3 (Day 6) - Social Proof + Value

Hey Pete,

Wanted to share something I think you'll find relevant.

Andrew Wilkinson (co-founder of Tiny) recently did a write-up on our service after we tested his home. What stood out to him was how many issues were completely invisible before the assessment. Here's the link: [Wilkinson write-up]

On a practical note, one thing we frequently find in homes with young children is elevated AC electrical fields in bedroom walls from wiring. Moving your daughter's bed 6-12 inches away from the wall can significantly reduce her exposure. This is especially worth doing if she has electronics plugged in near the bed (nightlights, monitors, etc.). For convenience, you can use a remote kill switch like this one [link] to easily cut power to bedside devices at night.

## Lead: Jordan Huelskamp

**Context:** Expecting a baby in August. Referred by Dr. Kachko at Atria. Budget: $2-5k. Health spend: $50k+/yr. Home: 2,501-3,500 sqft.

### FU 1 (Day 1) - Post-Call Value

Hey Jordan,

Great speaking with you, and congratulations on the baby!

Since you mentioned wanting to get the home environment as clean as possible before August, I wanted to share a few things you can do right now.

The most impactful one for expecting parents: get air purifiers covering the whole home, but prioritize the bedroom and the nursery. Studies have linked elevated particulate matter during pregnancy to changes in blood markers and metabolism, so addressing this early is important. Here's a link to our guide on how to choose the right air filter: [link]

When you get them, run them continuously at the highest fan-speed setting that's comfortable noise-wise. "Auto" mode only reacts when particles reach certain concentrations, so smaller particles can accumulate in the meantime.

Best,
Jay

### FU 2 (Day 3) - Second Value Drop

Hey Jordan,

One more thing on the nursery setup that I think is worth knowing about.

If you're planning to use a wireless baby monitor (like the Nanit), it's a significant source of RF radiation. Ideally, a wired monitor is best, but if that's not practical, a baby monitor shield (like this one: [link]) reduces exposure by around 70%. Happy to send one your way if you'd like, just send me your address.

Also, as a precautionary step, I'd position the crib 6-12 inches away from the wall. We frequently find elevated electrical fields behind bedroom walls from wiring, and increasing distance can significantly reduce exposure. This is one of the simplest things you can do for the nursery.

Here's our example report if you want to see the kind of detail we go into: https://www.lightworkhome.com/examplereport (password: homehealth). The EMF section (pages 20-30) would be particularly relevant.

Jay

### FU 3 (Day 6) - Social Proof + Value

Hey Jordan,

Dr. Kachko mentioned he's been referring patients to us, so I thought you might appreciate hearing his perspective directly:

"The science is clear: environmental factors have a major impact on health and cannot be ignored. We regularly refer our patients to Lightwork Home Health because holistic care requires addressing their home environment."

On a practical note, here's one more thing that's easy to do before the baby arrives: replace any ungrounded power strips near the nursery with grounded versions (like this one: [link] or this one with USB-C ports: [link]). And swap unshielded extension cords for shielded ones ([link]). These are small changes that meaningfully reduce EMF exposure in the room.

## Lead: Sam Reich

**Context:** Autoimmune issues, suspects water intrusion in home may be causing flare-ups. Health spend: $10-50k/yr. Budget: $5-10k. Home: 2,501-3,500 sqft.

### FU 1 (Day 1) - Post-Call Value

Hey Sam,

Great speaking with you today. Given what you shared about your autoimmune issues and the water intrusion, I wanted to pass along a few things.

On the mold front: if you've had water intrusion, there's a real possibility of hidden mold growth, even if you can't see or smell it. Most mold inspections rely on air sampling, which is notorious for false negatives. Mold is easily missed because the results depend heavily on airflow patterns at the specific moment of sampling. Two tests in the same location, just hours apart, could give completely different results.

The gold standard is a manual inspection by a skilled inspector using moisture meters, thermal cameras, and borescopes, combined with targeted MSQPCR testing (DNA-based analysis of dust that provides a snapshot of what mold has been present over time). That's how we approach it at Lightwork.

We wrote a detailed guide on how to test for mold the right way: [link to mold newsletter]. The key takeaway: a negative air sample doesn't mean the house is clean.

Best,
Jay

### FU 2 (Day 3) - Second Value Drop

Hey Sam,

Following up on the water quality side of things, since you mentioned water intrusion.

Beyond mold, water intrusion can introduce contaminants into the home that are easy to miss. We regularly detect heavy metals, radioactive elements, pesticides, and disinfection byproducts in tap water. Volatile organic compounds in water can vaporize in hot showers and get inhaled and absorbed through the skin, which is a common exposure pathway people don't think about.

Given your autoimmune concerns, it might be worth checking what's actually in your water. Here's a guide we wrote on water contaminants and how to address them: [link to water newsletter]

Also, here's our example report: https://www.lightworkhome.com/examplereport (password: homehealth). The water quality section (pages 30-37) and mold section (pages 38-45) would be the most relevant for your situation.

Best,
Jay

## What Makes This Better Than Generic Follow-Ups

1. **Every email teaches something actionable.** Pete can go switch his purifier off "Auto" mode tonight. Jordan can move the crib away from the wall. Sam can stop trusting his air sample mold test.

2. **Product recommendations with links.** Not vague advice, specific products they can buy right now (baby monitor shield, grounded power strips, Aranet4 CO2 monitor, HEPA vacuums).

3. **Personalized to their exact situation.** Pete's daughter has allergies, so he gets the particulate matter + mold angle. Jordan's expecting, so she gets the nursery safety angle. Sam has autoimmune issues, so he gets the mold + water contamination angle.

4. **No "just checking in."** Every single email has substance. Even if they never buy, these emails are useful.

5. **Builds trust through expertise.** By the time they've read 3-4 of these, they've seen you reference specific studies, give specific product recs, and demonstrate knowledge about THEIR specific situation. The assessment sells itself.

6. **The ask is invisible.** The example report link is there, but it's framed as "here's something useful for your situation" not "buy our service."
