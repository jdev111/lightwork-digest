## Core Philosophy: Stop Reminding, Start Selling

Haynes' central argument: **"Most email sequences suck. They remind. They nag. They 'follow up.' But they don't sell."**

His alternative: every email should deliver genuine value that builds trust, addresses objections, and moves the prospect closer to a buying decision. Never send a "just checking in" or "reminder: your call is tomorrow" email. Instead, send content that makes the prospect think, "This person clearly knows what they're doing."

**Old strategy:** "Reminder: Your call is tomorrow"
**New strategy:** "Here's why most people skip out on X, don't make the same mistake"

One builds trust. One gets archived.

## The Psychology: Scanner Mode vs. Justification Mode

Before someone books a call, they're in **scanner mode**, conserving energy, making quick decisions about whether something is relevant.

After they book (or after the call happens), they switch into **justification mode**, trying to determine if what they just did (or are about to do) was worth the energy. This is when they research, ask questions, and decide whether to move forward or ghost.

Most businesses send nothing during this critical window. That's the gap Haynes fills.

## The Hammer Them Strategy (Pre-Call Framework)

While this is technically pre-call, it establishes the principles Haynes applies to all follow-up:

- **18 emails** sent at **6 per day for 72 hours** between booking and the call
- **30-50 short-form video ads** (reels, TikTok-style) retargeted to the prospect
- **15-30 long-form video ads** (podcasts, talking-head) retargeted to the prospect
- Goal: prospect consumes **15-20 content pieces** before the call

All content is framed around four pillars:
1. **Questions** the prospect likely has
2. **Second-layer questions** (the questions behind the questions)
3. **Objections** they'll bring to the call
4. **Expectations** for what working together looks like

The email content is NOT short reminders with links. Haynes writes the **entire video script into long, value-dense emails**. Each email functions as a standalone content piece.

Key insight: "If the content is actually valuable, people appreciate it. If someone is an ideal customer and they open the email, they're getting exactly what they need to know."

## Post-Call Follow-Up: The Revenue Leak Problem

Haynes identifies the #1 post-call revenue leak:

> "Your salespeople are busy with full calendars. They don't follow up with people who didn't close. Only follow up with 'send me info next week' type deals. Meanwhile dozens of qualified prospects per week just disappear. That's a big revenue leak."

His position: you must have a **systematic** post-call follow-up process, not one dependent on individual salespeople remembering to follow up.

## Post-Call Content Strategy (Hammer Them Phase 3)

Haynes explicitly breaks the Hammer Them strategy into stages with **different content at each stage:**

- **DM comes in** --> Hammer with content (awareness/education content)
- **Setter books call** --> Different content (pre-call trust building, objection handling)
- **After closing call** --> Different content again (post-call nurture, social proof, urgency)

> "Content changes based on where they are in the process. Not random spray and pray."

## Post-Call Email Sequence Structure

Based on Haynes' frameworks, here is how post-call follow-up sequences should be structured:

### The Critical Stat
First-call close rates average just **12%** across high-ticket offers, while second-call closes account for **46%**. Plan follow-up into your process from the beginning rather than expecting immediate commitments.

### Cadence
- **Every-other-day cadence** converts 23% better than daily sends and 47% better than weekly
- For high-ticket: a **7-9 email sequence over 10-14 days** is the recommended framework

### Email Sequence Structure (Post-Call Adaptation)

| Email | Timing | Purpose | Content Type |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Same day / within hours | Recap + value delivery | Summary of what was discussed, link to relevant resource, set expectations for next steps |
| 2 | Day 2 | Address primary objection | Long-form value email tackling the #1 reason people hesitate (usually price/timing) |
| 3 | Day 4 | Case study / social proof | Real results from someone in a similar situation, written as a story |
| 4 | Day 6 | Second-layer question | Address the deeper concern they didn't voice on the call |
| 5 | Day 8 | Expectation setting | What working together actually looks like, day-to-day reality |
| 6 | Day 10 | Reframe + soft urgency | Why waiting costs more than acting, framed as insight not pressure |
| 7 | Day 12-14 | Direct invitation | Clear call to action to book a second call or move forward |

### The 80/20 Value-to-Pitch Ratio
- **80% pure value**, 20% promotional content
- This approach retains subscribers **3.2x longer** and converts **2.1x better** than aggressive pitch sequences
- Never let urgency or sales pressure dominate the sequence

### Personalization
"Personalization beyond just first names increases conversion by 41%." Reference content they've consumed, acknowledge their specific situation, and connect back to what was discussed on the call.

## Building Trust Rapidly (Rule #4)

For high-ticket prospects who need to justify a large purchase:

Send **trust assets** alongside your email sequence:
- **Decks** (presentation materials explaining the offer in detail)
- **PPMs / risk disclosure documents** (shows professionalism and transparency)
- **Team member information** (who they'll be working with)
- **Background checks** (builds institutional trust)
- **"The Rolodex"**: information about previous clients, their results, and returns

> "Rich people make decisions quickly because they're attempting to save time. You have to build trust rapidly."

## Handling Non-Responsive Leads

### Reactivation Campaigns
- Run reactivation campaigns every **3-6 months** targeting engaged non-buyers
- These convert at **4-7%**, which is significant when applied to a large list
- Segment lists by engagement level and interests; segmented nurture converts **37% better**

### The Content-First Approach to Re-engagement
Rather than sending "Are you still interested?" emails, Haynes' approach is to continue delivering value through the same content framework:
- Questions they still likely have
- Second-layer questions
- Objections reframed
- New case studies and results

The content itself does the selling. If they're still a good fit, the value will pull them back. If not, they'll unsubscribe, which cleans your list.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

1. **Never send reminder emails.** Every email must deliver standalone value.
2. **Write long.** Put the full teaching in the email body, not behind a link.
3. **Frame content around the four pillars:** questions, second-layer questions, objections, expectations.
4. **Different content for different stages.** Pre-call, post-call, and non-responsive leads each need distinct messaging.
5. **Systematize follow-up.** Don't rely on salespeople to remember. Build automated sequences.
6. **The first call rarely closes.** Plan for the second call from the start.
7. **80/20 ratio.** Value first, pitch second. Always.
8. **Send trust assets.** Decks, case studies, team bios, and social proof accelerate decisions.
9. **Reactivate every 3-6 months.** Non-buyers today may buy later when timing shifts.
10. **Personalize beyond the first name.** Reference the call, their situation, and the content they've engaged with.
