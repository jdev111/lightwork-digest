# Alex Hormozi's Follow-Up & Value-Driven Sales Principles
## Applied to a 7-Touch Premium Home Health Consulting Cadence ($9-10K Service)

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Give Until They Ask"

Hormozi's central conviction is that trust compounds over time. The longer you provide value before asking for the sale, the higher the conversion rate when you finally do ask. His recommended give-to-ask ratio is **30:1** for overall business interactions, and roughly **3.5:1** within any individual content sequence (modeled after television's 47 minutes of content to 13 minutes of ads per hour).

**Application to a 7-touch cadence:** At most 2 of the 7 emails should contain a direct CTA or offer. The other 5 should deliver pure value, education, or proof. The prospect should feel like they are getting a private consultation for free before they ever spend a dollar.

---

## 2. The "Solve One Problem, Reveal a Bigger One" Lead Magnet Principle

Hormozi uses the analogy of free pretzels at a bar: they solve hunger but create thirst, which leads to drink purchases. Your lead magnet (or value-driven email content) should solve a narrow, immediate problem that naturally reveals a larger problem only your core service can address.

**Application:** Each value email should solve a specific, tangible concern the homeowner has (e.g., "3 things in your bedroom that disrupt sleep quality" or "the one water test your city report doesn't cover"). Solving that small problem makes them realize the scope of what they don't know, which is the bigger problem your $9-10K assessment addresses.

---

## 3. Follow-Up Cadence: Intensive Early, Then Sustained

Hormozi's tactical follow-up guidance is aggressive by conventional standards:

- **Speed to Lead:** Contact within 60 seconds of inquiry. Delays past 5 minutes reduce close rates by 80%.
- **First 5 Days:** Follow up 2-3 times per day (across channels, not just email). This signals persistence and genuine concern, not desperation.
- **After 5 Days:** Transition to a slower cadence with ongoing value delivery.
- **Minimum Touches:** 5-7 follow-ups before moving on. 80% of leads don't buy on first contact.

**Application for a premium service:** The intensity of 2-3x/day is designed for sales calls and gym launches, so it needs translation. For a $9-10K home health service, the equivalent is:

- Touch 1 (Day 0): Immediate personalized response
- Touch 2 (Day 2): Value-driven educational content
- Touch 3 (Day 5): Case study or proof element
- Touch 4 (Day 8): Different angle on the problem
- Touch 5 (Day 12): Social proof or third-party validation
- Touch 6 (Day 17): Direct but soft offer with scarcity
- Touch 7 (Day 22): Final breakup or re-engagement email

This maps Hormozi's "intensive early, then sustained" philosophy to a timeline appropriate for high-consideration purchases.

## 4. The ACA Framework (Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask)

This is Hormozi's conversation framework for outreach, designed to feel human rather than transactional:

- **Acknowledge:** Reference something specific about the prospect (their home, their concern, their situation).
- **Compliment:** Give a genuine compliment related to what you acknowledged (e.g., "It's clear you take your family's health seriously").
- **Ask:** Pose a transitional question that connects naturally to your offer (e.g., "Have you ever had your indoor air quality tested?").

**Application:** Every email in the cadence should open with acknowledgment and personalization. Never open with your service. Open with their world.

---

## 5. The CLOSER Framework (For When They're Ready to Talk)

Hormozi's sales call structure, relevant when a follow-up converts to a phone call:

- **C - Clarify:** Why are they interested? What prompted this?
- **L - Label:** Name their specific problem so it becomes concrete.
- **O - Overview:** Discuss what they've already tried (DIY air purifiers, basic water filters, etc.) and why it wasn't enough.
- **S - Sell the Vacation:** Don't sell the inspection process. Sell the outcome: sleeping deeply, breathing clean air, knowing their kids' water is safe. Paint the picture of life after the assessment.
- **E - Explain Away Concerns:** Handle objections with the Triple A method (Acknowledge the concern, Associate it with buying behavior by sharing stories of past clients who had the same concern and still moved forward, Ask a question that moves them forward).
- **R - Reinforce:** After they buy, immediately reinforce the decision with a personal video, welcome package, or handwritten note.

**Application:** The follow-up emails should progressively move prospects through C-L-O-S stages so that by the time they get on a call, they've already self-qualified through Clarify, Label, and Overview. The emails do the heavy lifting; the call just handles S, E, and R.

---

## 6. Each Follow-Up Must Do One of Three Things

Based on Hormozi's frameworks, every touch in a sequence should serve one specific purpose:

1. **Deliver value that solves a small problem** (education, insight, a specific actionable tip)
2. **Provide proof that reduces risk** (case study, testimonial, before/after, data)
3. **Address a specific objection or concern** (cost justification, "is this really necessary," timing)

Never send a follow-up that just "checks in." Every message must earn its place by moving the prospect closer to a decision.

---

## 7. Long-Term Greedy vs. Short-Term Greedy

Hormozi's philosophical anchor: "If you want to get rich, be long-term greedy instead of short-term greedy." Trust compounds. If a prospect doesn't convert in your 7-touch sequence, they go into a long-term nurture where you continue providing value (newsletter, content, seasonal tips) without asking for anything. Some of the highest-value clients will come back months later because you never pressured them but also never disappeared.

**Application:** The 7-touch cadence is not the end. Unconverted leads should flow into the Lightwork Letter or a monthly value-add sequence. Hormozi says explicitly: "They are just the type of person who needs more information to make a decision. I'm just going to provide more value over a longer period of time."

---

## 8. The Rule of 100

Hormozi's volume principle: every day, do at least 100 outreach actions (messages, calls, content pieces) or spend $100 on ads. Consistency over 90 days produces results regardless of skill level.

**Application to follow-up cadence design:** The system must be automated and consistent. A 7-touch cadence that fires reliably for every lead, every time, will outperform brilliant one-off emails sent inconsistently. Build the system first, then optimize the copy.

---

## 9. Personalization is Non-Negotiable

Hormozi stresses researching 1-3 specific personal details about each prospect before outreach. Generic templates get ignored. Personalized openers get read. For cold outreach, this means referencing their specific neighborhood, home age, family situation, or the concern that prompted their inquiry.

**Application:** The first 1-2 sentences of every follow-up email should reference something specific to that prospect. Even in a templated sequence, the opening must be customized. This is especially true for a $9-10K service where the prospect expects a premium, personalized experience from the first interaction.

## Summary: The 7 Hormozi Principles for a Premium Follow-Up Cadence

| # | Principle | One-Line Application |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Give 30x before you ask 1x | 5 value emails for every 2 that contain an offer |
| 2 | Solve small, reveal big | Each email solves a narrow concern that points to the full assessment |
| 3 | Speed + intensity early, value sustained | Respond immediately, front-load the cadence, then space out |
| 4 | ACA every opener | Acknowledge their world before talking about yours |
| 5 | Pre-sell through CLOSER stages | Emails should move them through C-L-O so the call only needs S-E-R |
| 6 | Every touch earns its place | Value, proof, or objection handling. Never "just checking in" |
| 7 | Long-term greedy | Unconverted leads get nurtured indefinitely with value, not pressure |
